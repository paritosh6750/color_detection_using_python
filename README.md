# Color Detection Using Python

## 🎨 Colour Detection using Python, Pandas & OpenCV

An interactive Python application that detects the **name** and **RGB values** of any color in an image with just a **double-click**.  
This project is built with **OpenCV**, **Pandas**, and **NumPy**, using a dataset of 865 color names for accurate detection.  

---

## 📌 Features
- **Instant Color Detection** – Double-click anywhere on the image to get the color name and RGB values.
- **CSV-based Color Dataset** – Includes 865 predefined color names with RGB and HEX values.
- **Real-time Display** – Color name and values appear in a color-filled rectangle on the image.
- **Light/Dark Text Adjustment** – Automatically adjusts text color for visibility.
- **Simple & Beginner-Friendly** – Perfect for learning OpenCV and event handling.
